This little tiny project tries to determine the reading level of a given excerpt (`input`) and uses the [Flesch-Kincaid Readability Test for US Grades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests#Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_grade_level). It also counts how many adverbs you use because you shouldn't frequently employ them haphazardly.
